Rock Paper Scissors | Third Project | The Odin Project | Learning Web Development
# Note
> This project currently contains the basic **Rock-Paper-Scissors logic** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).
> - The game logic is fully functional.
> - Results and game status are currently visible in the **browser console** (`console.log`).
> - A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** will be added as I progress further in The Odin Project curriculum.  

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
